# This is the main configuration file for the Brigade chart.
# To override values here, specify them in your own YAML file, and override
# during install or upgrade:
#
#    $ helm install -n brigade -f myValues.yaml brigade/brigade
#
# By default, the chart will install without RBAC. To install with
# RBAC, set `rbac.enabled` to `true`.
#
# To disable the GitHub gateway, set `gw.enabled` to `false`. This will mean
# that no GitHub hooks will work, though scripts will still be able to mount
# GitHub projects based on the Project configuration.
#

# If enabled, roles, role bindings will be turned on.
# IMPORTANT: The RBAC system is complex, and if you are using RBACs in your
# cluster, you may need to evaluate existing rules and accounts in addition
# to the rules created here. We recommend that you understand RBACs
# before enabling this.
