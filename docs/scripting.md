# Scripting Guide

This guide explains the basics of events available to `brigade.js` files.

For more, see the [Brigade Scripting Guide](https://github.com/brigadecore/brigade/blob/master/docs/topics/scripting.md)

# Brigade Bitbucket Events

Brigade listens for certain things to happen, this gateway provides those such events from a Bitbucket repository. The events that Brigade listens for are configured in your project.

When Brigade observes such an event, it will load the `brigade.js` file and see if there is an event handler that matches the event.

For example:

```javascript
const { events } = require("brigadier")

events.on("push", () => {
  console.log("==> handling an 'push' event")
})
```

The Bitbucket Gateway produces 16 events:

```
push
repo:commit_comment_created
repo:commit_status_created
repo:commit_status_updated
issue:created
issue:updated
issue:comment_created
pullrequest:created
pullrequest:updated
pullrequest:approved
pullrequest:unapproved
pullrequest:fulfilled
pullrequest:rejected
pullrequest:comment_created
pullrequest:comment_updated
pullrequest:comment_deleted
```

and two not supported: `repo:fork`, `repo:updated` as these are currently considered no-ops. The Pull Request events are questionable to support, please open an issue if you have any use-case issues.

These are based on the events described in the [Bitbucket Webhooks API](https://confluence.atlassian.com/bitbucket/manage-webhooks-735643732.html) guide.
